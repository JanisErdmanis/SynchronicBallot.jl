And when card is being sent ready to the local authorities the unlock key is sent to the place from the Vendoor. There at local authority the person can register his anonymous public key safely.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"SharedBallot anonymous and unique message registration protocol","title":"SharedBallot anonymous and unique message registration protocol","text":"The second way is by starting with an elligible person public keys and use them to register anonymous public keys.

Keyserver checks that user public key is elligible. User checks that he had connected the right server. \nThe keyserver generates and sends to the user a blockkey at the moment when N elligible members had reached this stage to make a block full. \nUser uses TOR or other ip anonymizer and estblishes the anonymous connection with keyserver which he secures with blockkey. That acts as verification of the server that the right person had contacted him.\nUser sends his unique message in a random time withn the interval which was specified in the blockey. He waits until delivery time had ended and closes the secure connection.\nThe block is constructed by the server and sent over the secure connection to each user.\nThe user checks if his unique message is in the block and sends back a user signature of the block to the server.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"SharedBallot anonymous and unique message registration protocol","title":"SharedBallot anonymous and unique message registration protocol","text":"To use it for PeaceVote mobile system we use user generated public key as a message.

The attacks still can be made by a dishonest potential member who then can register multiple public keys. However such block would never be accepted and thus signed by all elligible memebers. If problem persists one can try to isolate/rearange dishonest memeber until the procedure succeeds.","category":"page"}]
